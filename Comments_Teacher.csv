"The theory and practicals are not aligned well for students to understand application of techniques. Practicals are not prepared according to standard guidelines. Practicals don't explain accuracy and troubleshooting. There should be Teaching Assistants demonstrating techniques to small groups and help them do it by themselves until the students are confident to do it by themselves. The budget, space and time alotted should be tripled to carry out practicals in the best possible way. "
