Approaches and Methodology adopted 
"I do not start my Ph.D. yet, hope to apply soon. However, according to me, some gaps that I have are lack of clear knowledge or expertise in  1)statistics/biostatistics 2)programming language, for example, R, Python 3) not fluent using Linux operating system. All of them are crucial for being an expert researcher in the microbiology field, and I feel I do not have enough skills in those areas."
